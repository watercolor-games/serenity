# Serenity

Serenity is a cross-platform (Windows and Linux) editor environment for the [Peace Engine](https://github.com/watercolor-games/peace-engine). It is designed to aid development in The Peacenet, but can (and is recommended to) be used to makee your own games in Peace Engine.

### Where'd the name come from?

Serenity is a synonym for peace, the feeling we'd like to give developers when they are working with our engine. You should not have to read a manual the size of my forearm just to navigate the UI, but the editor environment should still be advanced. You should be able to accomplish more advanced projects even as a beginner user.

### Features

Serenity will be capable of the following:

1. **Code editing**. You'll be able to write scripts for Peace Engine entities, components, UIs, scenes, etc in C#, Visual Basic, Python or Lua - with syntax highlighting, code collapsing, code completion, and other advanced features.
2. **Content processing**. Import textures, audio, video, and other assets into the engine to use in your game without needing to interact directly with the MonoGame Content Pipeline.
3. **You should never have to deal with Visual Studio or MonoDevelop** unless you are directly modifying the engine or editor source code.
4. **UI design.** Serenity will allow you to design Peace Engine UIs in a familiar drag-and-drop environment for those who use the Windows Forms editor in Visual Studio.
5. **UI theme editing.** Make your own UI themes to suit your game without writing code. You can even import ShiftOS 0.0.x and 1.x `.skn` files and extend them into the Peace Engine theming system.
6. **Scene editor.** Add components, entities, etc and place them in a 2D or 3D scene. You can script that scene to make things do stuff. Or you can animate things right in the UI using keyframes. Or both.
7. **Audio cue editor.** Using the `AdvancedAudioPlayer` component for background music? You won't need Audacity to generate cue info. Serenity will let you do it in-engine.

There's many more planned, but those are the biggies.
